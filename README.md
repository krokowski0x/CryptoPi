# CryptoPi.js

Cryptocurrency price-tracking app with Raspberry Pi and Google Assistant integration.

## Brief description

Goal of this project is to have a handy on-desk **Cryptocurrency Tracker** that displays prices data like in that old-school [LED Stock Tickers](https://www.google.pl/search?q=led+stock+ticker&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjggLDyz-_aAhXB2qQKHb6qDBoQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=974).
App will eventually also let you **buy/sell crypto, set stop-losses and alert big price changes**.
Further development also consist of integration with [Google Assistant](https://assistant.google.com) with [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) recognizing voice commands.
