# CryptoPi.js (Arduino Version)

Cryptocurrency price-tracking app mock with Arduino Uno Rev 3.

## Brief description

This is a branch that is used for testing **hardware and prototyping**.
The goal is to have the same functionality as the original app but with **Arduino Uno Rev 3** instead of Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and with mock data (because of lack of Internet connection).
