# CryptoPi.js

## Brief description

App lets you keep track of prices of the most popular cryptos with hand gestures and soon with voice.
It was mocked with Arduino, because of lack of Wi-Fi in Uno Rev 3 model, but now it's being developed on Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

## Main features

* Single Currency Mode - switching between currencies via hand gesture
* Ticker Tape Mode - crypto prices sliding like on old-school 90's Wall St. Ticker Tapes
* Trading/Account Mode - Check Your balance, buy/sell cryptos with a few button clicks
* Custom menu build as a Tree of Linked Lists
